# MCPPlayground
A small project, trying out the .NET SDK for ModelContextProtocel (MCP).
The project contains an MCP server with 3 tools, that integrates to the public [Open Brewery DB API](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/).

The porject is based on [this blogpost](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/build-a-model-context-protocol-mcp-server-in-csharp/#getting-started-building-an-mcp-server)

The blogpost also contains information on how to enable the server in Visual Studio Code.
